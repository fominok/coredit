and+ to provide a layer to compute chars to move. Also it may require a
config layer to setup what the word actually is
*** TODO Paragraphs

of text objects; is number of text object classes limited?

**** TODO Insertion
***** TODO Keyboard
***** TODO Clipboard

Yanking of multiple selections should store all of the entries
