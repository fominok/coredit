* Implement
** Movements
*** Selections
Up/Down movements
Exend or not
*** Selection storage
Unify over 4 directions and provide LineLength
*** Words
This one is tough and requires actually link with underlying rope
and provide a layer to compute chars to move. Also it may require a
config layer to setup what the word actually is
*** Paragraphs
Mostly the same, but should it provide different interface for many types
of text objects; is number of text object classes limited?
