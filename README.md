# Coredit
[![Latest Release][crates-io-badge]][crates-io-url]
[![Documentation][docs-rs-badge]][docs-rs-url]

ðŸ–‹ A text editor buffer component based on [Ropey][ropey-url]
with multiselection heavy lifting.

## What Coredit is
While there are crates providing data structures to keep text
maintaining performance on random access the other common part
is how a cursor should act. Inspired by [Kakoune][kakoune-url],
Coredit attempts to simplify creation of a custom text editor
with sensible defaults, including multiple selections.

## What Coredit is not
It's not an editor: at least you need to attach a keyboard
reader and to draw current state. However, there is a minimal
editor in `examples` directory (`cargo run --example edi`).

Coredit doesn't try to be full-featured: it is busy storing
text, doing manual changes and controlling selections. LSP
integrations, Lua scripting, highlighting and `M-x doctor`
could be main features of the text editor you made, but they
should not belong to the buffer core.

## State of the crate
By tradition, let's call this a _very WIP_. Seriously,
there is a known room for improvement by means of performance,
also API may become heavier if the idea of "minimal core" is
not that good.

## A note about selection-first
If you want to use this crate to create an editor with `|` style
cursor think about it like you still have a selection of a character
after it, at least when you press `Delete` something gets
deleted even if it is "not selected". One case when it should be
drawn _after_ is a selection with a cursor placed in the end. (ok I may be wrong)
